# Wherehouse.io SpaceEx Sample Project made by Ankit Bhowmik

## Designing

1) I've used Atomic atomic design pattern to maintain the file structure.
    atomic folder structure includes 
    1) atom :- Basic building blocks such as a button or text.
    2) molecule :- Grouping atoms together.
    3) organism: :- Combining molecules together 
    4) template :- Consisting mostly of groups of organisms to form a page.

2) used Styled-components for css styling.
3) UI is clean and mobile first approach is used.
4) fully responsive for tablet, desktop.
5) max-width is 1440px after that the content will be centered.


## Functionality

1) I've used Redux for global state management.
2) Redux stores all the values for Launches and display to frontend.
3) Added filter functionality by year, launch success, land success.
