    1) atom :- Basic building blocks such as a button or text.
    2) molecule :- Grouping atoms together.
    3) organism: :- Combining molecules together 
    4) template :- Consisting mostly of groups of organisms to form a page.

2) used Styled-components for css styling.
3) UI is clean and mobile first approach is used.
4) fully responsive for tablet, desktop.
5) max-width is 1440px after that the content will be centered.
